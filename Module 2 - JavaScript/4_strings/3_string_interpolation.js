// 👉 Template literals (String Interpolation)

// ES6 template literals provide the syntax that allows you to work with strings in a much cleaner way. In ES6, we can create a template literal by wrapping the string in backticks.

const studentName = "Mohit";
const score = 97;
const subject = "english";

console.log(
  `Congrats ${studentName}, You got ${score} marks in ${subject} subject 👍.`
);
