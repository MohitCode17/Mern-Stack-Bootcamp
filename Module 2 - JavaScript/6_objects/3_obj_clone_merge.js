👉 Cloning and Merging of an Object

Copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

This is the one posible way to clone an object:

let user = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 43,
};

let clone = {};

for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}

Now clone is fully independent object with same content

clone.name = "Peter";
console.log(user.name); // still "John Doe"

👉 Shallow Copy vs Deep copy

There are two ways to clone an object in Javascript:

1. Shallow copy: means that only the first level of the object is copied. Deeper levels are referenced.
2. Deep copy: means that all levels of the object are copied. This is a true copy of the object.

👉 Shallow copy

A shallow copy can be achieved using the spread operator (…) or using Object.assign():

👉 Object.assign

let person = { name: "John" };

let permission1 = { canView: true };
let permission2 = { canEdit: true };

Object.assign(person, permission1, permission2);
console.log(person); // {name: 'John', canView: true, canEdit: true}

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

Object.assign(person, { name: "Peter" });
console.log(person);

// We also can use Object.assign to perform simple object cloning

let person1 = Object.assign({}, person);
console.log("Person 1:", person1); // {name: 'Peter', canView: true, canEdit: true}

👉 Shallow Copy using Spread Operator

let product = {
  id: 10,
  name: "Titan Watch",
  made: "India",
};

let product2 = { ...product };
product2.name = "Raymond Shirt";
console.log(product);
console.log(product2);

👉 Deep Copy

// A deep copy can be achieved using JSON.parse() + JSON.stringify()

let user1 = {
  name: "James Anderson",
  sizes: {
    height: 187,
    wight: 85,
  },
};

Now it’s not enough to copy clone1.sizes = user1.sizes, because user1.sizes is an object, and will be copied by reference, so clone1 and user1 will share the same sizes:

let clone1 = Object.assign({}, user1);
console.log(clone1.sizes === user1.sizes); // true, share same reference

clone1.sizes.wight = 90;
console.log(user1.sizes.wight); // 90, change the property in orginal array, because of references.

👉 JSON.parse + JSON.stringify:

const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(user1));
deepCopy.sizes.wight = 200;
console.log("Deepcopy:", deepCopy); // weight = 200
console.log("User 1:", user1); // weight = 85

👉 Deep clone using structuredClone

// The call structuredClone(object) clones the object with all nested properties.

let clone2 = structuredClone(user1);
console.log("Clone 2:", clone2);
console.log(clone2.sizes === user1.sizes); // false

clone2.sizes.height = 170;

console.log(user1); // still 187, changing in clone2 won't affect in user1.

Limitations:-

1. Not universally supported: Available in most modern browsers and environments, but older environments might not support it.
2. No functions: structuredClone cannot clone functions, so any methods or function properties within the object will be lost.
