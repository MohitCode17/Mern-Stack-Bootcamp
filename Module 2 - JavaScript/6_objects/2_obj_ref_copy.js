👉 Object References and Copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects copied “by reference”, whereas primitive values are always copied “as a whole value”.

👉 Let's start with primitive

let message = "Hello!";
let copyMessage = message;

console.log(message);
console.log(copyMessage);

/*
+------------+       +----------------+
|  message   |       |  copyMessage   |
+------------+       +----------------+
|   "Hello!" |       |    "Hello!"    |
+------------+       +----------------+

- message and copyMessage are separate boxes (or memory locations).
- Each box holds the value "Hello!" independently, as primitive values are copied by value, not by reference.
- Changes to message won’t affect copyMessage and vice versa.

copyMessage = `${message} Mohit`;
console.log(copyMessage); // Hello! Mohit
console.log(message); // Hello

👉 Let's start with Objects

A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it.

let user = {
  name: "John Doe",
};

Here’s how it’s actually stored in memory:

   +-------+               +-----------------+
   | user  |-------------> |   name:         |
   +-------+               |     "John Doe"  |
                           +-----------------+

The object is stored somewhere in memory, while the user variable has a “reference” to it.

When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.

let admin = user;

   +-------+               +-----------------+
   | user  |-------------> |   { name:       |
   +-------+               |     "John Doe"  |
                           +-----------------+
                               ^
                               |
   +------------+              |
   |   admin    |--------------+
   +------------+

admin.name = "James Anderson";
console.log(admin); // {name: "James Anderson"}
console.log(user); // {name: "James Anderson"}

👉 Comparison by reference

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.
For instance, here a and b reference the same object, thus they are equal:

const a = {};
const b = a;
console.log(a === b); // true

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):

const c = {};
const d = {};
console.log(c === d); // false
