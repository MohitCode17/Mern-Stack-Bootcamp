/*
ðŸ‘‰ What is Conditional Statements ?

Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

ðŸ‘‰ If Statement

The `if` statement only runs if the condition enclosed in parentheses () is `truthy`.

let year = prompt(
  "In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?",
  ""
);

if (year == 2015) alert("You are right!");

ðŸ‘‰ Else Statement

You can extend an if statement with an else statement, which adds another block to run when the if conditional doesnâ€™t pass.

if (year == 2015) {
  alert("You guessed it right!");
} else {
  alert("How can you be so wrong?");
}

ðŸ‘‰ Else If Statement

You can also extend an if statement with an else if statement, which adds another conditional with its own block.

if (year < 2015) {
  alert("Too early...");
} else if (year > 2015) {
  alert("Too late");
} else {
  alert("Exactly!");
}
