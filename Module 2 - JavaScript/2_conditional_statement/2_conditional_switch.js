/*
ðŸ‘‰ What is Switch Case Statement ?

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

ðŸ‘‰ This is how it works:

1. The switch expression is evaluated once.
2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
3. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
4. If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
