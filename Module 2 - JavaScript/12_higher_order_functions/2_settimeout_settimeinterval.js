/* 
ðŸ‘‰ SetTimeOut and SetInterval

Sometime we want to delay the execution of certain code, or to repeat code at a specific interval.

There are two native functions in the JavaScript library used to accomplish these tasks: setTimeout() and setInterval().

ðŸ‘‰ 1. setTimeout

setTimeout is a function in JavaScript that allows you to execute a specified piece of code or function after a specified period of time (in milliseconds). It runs once after the delay, not repeatedly.

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(`This is a callback function executed after 5 seconds.`);
}, 1000);

The setTimeout function returns a unique ID that you can use later to cancel the timeout if needed.

ðŸ‘‰ 2. clearTimeout

clearTimeout is a function that cancels a previously set timeout before it has a chance to execute. You need the ID returned by setTimeout to cancel it.

const timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(`This message will not be displayed.`);
}, 3000);

clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Cancels the timeout, so the message will not appear

ðŸ‘‰ 3. setInterval

setInterval is similar to setTimeout, but instead of executing the code once, it keeps executing the specified function at regular intervals (in milliseconds) until it is stopped.

function displayMessage(productName, discount) {
  let advertiseMessage = `Limited-Time Offer! Grab ${productName} at ${discount}% off! Only for Today. Hurry, stock is running low!`;

  console.log(advertiseMessage);
}

let intervalId = setInterval(function () {
  displayMessage();
}, 1000);

setInterval returns an interval ID which can be used to stop the interval later.

ðŸ‘‰ 4. clearInterval

clearInterval stops a previously set interval, preventing it from executing any further. Like clearTimeout, you need the ID returned by setInterval to clear it.

clearInterval(intervalId);

Example:-

let counter = 0;
let intervalId1 = setInterval(() => {
  counter += 1;
  console.log("Counter: " + counter);

  if (counter === 5) {
    // Stop after 5 iterations
    clearInterval(intervalId1);
  }
}, 1000);
