/*
ðŸ‘‰ Local Scope

Local scope in JavaScript is like a private room within a building â€“ it's an enclosed space where variables are only accessible from within that specific room.

Variables in local scope are typically declared within functions, conditional statements, loops, or other code blocks.

Variables in local scope are protected from interference or modification by code outside their scope, providing a level of isolation.

function myFunction() {
  var localVariable = "I'm local scope variable";
  console.log(localVariable);
}
myFunction();

console.log(localVariable); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localVariable is not defined
