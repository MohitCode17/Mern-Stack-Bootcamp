ðŸ‘‰ Block Scope

Block scope is created within specific code blocks, such as conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while).

Variables declared in block scope are confined to that block, offering a high degree of isolation.

if (true) {
  let blockVariable = "I'm in block scope.";
  console.log(blockVariable);
}

Accessing blockVariable here would result in an error

ðŸ‘‰ Differences between Block Scope and Local Scope

Block scope is often confused with local scope, but there's a key distinction.

In local scope, variables are typically defined within a function, while block scope is created within code blocks like if, for, or while statements.

Local scope is function-level, meaning it encompasses the entire function, while block scope is limited to the specific block where the variable is declared.

function myFunction() {
  if (true) {
    var localVariable = "I'm in block scope";
    let blockVariable = "I'm also in block scope";
  }
  console.log(localVariable); // Accessible
  console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
}

In this example, localVariable is accessible within the function because it's in local scope. On the other hand, blockVariable is accessible only within the if block due to block scope.


ðŸ‘‰ How to Use Block Scope with let and const

The introduction of the let and const keywords in JavaScript significantly enhanced block scope.

These keywords allow you to declare variables with block scope, making it easier to control variable visibility and lifespan.

function exampleBlockScope() {
  if (true) {
    let blockVariable = "I'm block-scoped with 'let'";
    const constantBlockVar = "I'm block-scoped with 'const'";
  }
  console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
  console.log(constantBlockVar); // Error: constantBlockVar is not defined
}
