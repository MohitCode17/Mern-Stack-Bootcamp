/*
ðŸ‘‰ What is Scope?

Scope refers to the environment in which variables are declared and can be accessed. JavaScript offers various types of scope, with the three primary ones being `global`, `function`, and `block` scope.

ðŸ‘‰ Global scope

Variables declared in global scope are typically defined outside of any functions or code of block. Can be accessed anywhere in the program.

var globalVariable = "I am a global variable";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(globalVariable); // I am a global variable
}

myFunction();
console.log(globalVariable); // I am a global variable

if (true) {
  console.log(globalVariable); // I am a global variable
}

ðŸ‘‰ Potential Issues with Global Scope

Since global variables are accessible from anywhere, they are less modular and organized. If everything is in the town square, it becomes challenging to manage and isolate different aspects of your program.
